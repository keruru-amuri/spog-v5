# Architecture Document
# SPOG Inventory Management Web App

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the architectural design of the SPOG Inventory Management Web App. It provides a high-level overview of the system components, their interactions, and the technical decisions that shape the application architecture.

### 1.2 Scope
This architecture document covers the frontend, backend, database, and deployment infrastructure of the SPOG Inventory Management Web App.

### 1.3 Audience
This document is intended for developers, system administrators, and technical stakeholders involved in the development, deployment, and maintenance of the application.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Context
The SPOG Inventory Management Web App is a full-stack web application designed to track and manage inventory of sealants, paints, oils, and greases. The system allows users to monitor stock levels, record consumption, generate reports, and receive alerts for low stock or expiring items.

### 2.2 Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between frontend, backend, and database layers
- **Modularity**: Components designed to be modular and reusable
- **Scalability**: Architecture that can scale with increasing users and data
- **Security**: Security considerations built into the architecture
- **Maintainability**: Code organization that facilitates maintenance and updates
